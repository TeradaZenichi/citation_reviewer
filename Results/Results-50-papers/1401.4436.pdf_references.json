Among non-bootstrapping approaches, Ando (2004) presents a new method of constructing semantic lexicons from an unannotated corpus using a set of semantic classes and a set of seed words and phrases for each semantic class. She uses spectral analysis to improve the feature vectors by projecting the useful portions of the vectors into a subspace and removing the \u201charmful\u201d portions of the vectors. The resultant feature vectors are then used by a centroid-based classifier using cosine similarity measure to label the words. Avancini, Lavelli, Sebastiani, and Zanoli (2006) take a classification approach to semantic lexicon construction. The former, called RAndom k-LabELsets, or RAKEL, builds an ensemble of classifiers by randomly sampling label sets of size k; whereas the latter adopts the method of filtering observed label sets by minimum support. Tang et al. (2009), on the other hand, take a different approach: they train one classifier that predicts the number of labels that a test instance would have, and then choose that many labels for that instance based on output of another classifier that ranks the labels by likelihood for that instance.",

These test sare compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for the difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 \u00d7 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5\u00d72 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, Mc-Nemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 \u00d7 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.

However, the use of these simple features is relevant for the task and is motivated by the work performed by the NASA researchers, who, as mentioned above, have manually identified seed words and phrases for each shaping factor (Posse et al., 2005). As discussed by Posse et al. (2005) and Ferryman, Posse, Rosenthal, Srivastava, and Statler (2006), only the narrative of a report contains information on the shaping factors of the incident. As discussed by Posse et al. (2005) and Ferryman, Posse, Rosenthal, Srivastava, and Statler (2006), only the narrative of a report contains information on the shaping factors of the incident. Posse et al. (2005) focus on the 14 shaping factors, or simply shapers. While NASA has previously developed a heuristic approach to tackle the cause identification task (Posse et al., 2005), this approach was evaluated on only 20 manually annotated reports, which is far from satisfactory as far as establishing a strong baseline method is concerned. As mentioned previously, their use is motivated by the labor-intensive procedure that the NASA researchers employed in manually identifying seed words and phrases for each shaping factor (Posse et al., 2005). Both approaches exploit information provided by a semantic lexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloff\u2019s (2002) Basilisk framework augmented with our three algorithmic modifications (namely, the use of a probabilistic similarity measure, the use of a common word pool, and the enforcement of minimum support and maximum generality constraints for words and extraction patterns) and one linguistic modification (the use of N-gram-based extraction patterns).",
