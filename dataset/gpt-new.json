      "sections": "Adaptive online learning algorithms are crucial in environments where data distributions change over time. We propose a novel approach that dynamically adjusts model parameters to adapt to non-stationary data streams. Our method combines elements of online gradient descent with a forgetting mechanism to prioritize recent information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets, showing improved performance over traditional online learning methods.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn many practical applications, data distributions are not stationary. For instance, user preferences in recommendation systems evolve, and sensor readings in monitoring systems may drift over time. Traditional online learning algorithms [1] often assume a stationary environment, leading to suboptimal performance when this assumption is violated.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nPrevious work on handling non-stationarity includes concept drift adaptation [2], ensemble methods [3], and algorithms with forgetting mechanisms [4]. These methods attempt to maintain performance by adjusting to changes in data distributions. However, they may suffer from high computational complexity or delayed adaptation.\n\n3 Proposed Method\n\nOur approach introduces an adaptive learning rate and a forgetting factor into the online gradient descent framework [5]. At each time step, the learning rate is adjusted based on the observed loss, and older data points are gradually down-weighted. This allows the model to focus on recent data, improving responsiveness to changes.\n\n4 Experiments\n\nWe evaluated our method on datasets including electricity demand [6], online retail [7], and real-time traffic data [8]. Our algorithm outperformed standard online learning methods and other adaptive techniques, particularly in scenarios with rapid distribution shifts.\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nAdaptive online learning in non-stationary environments is essential for many applications. Our proposed method provides a simple yet effective way to handle changing data distributions, leading to improved performance over existing approaches.\n\nAppendix\n\nA. Implementation Details\n\nWe implemented our algorithm using Python and optimized it for computational efficiency. Hyperparameters were selected based on cross-validation.\n\nB. Parameter Settings\n\n- Learning Rate: Initialized to 0.1 and adjusted adaptively.\n- Forgetting Factor: Set to 0.9 to prioritize recent data.\n- Evaluation Metrics: Mean squared error for regression tasks and accuracy for classification tasks.\n",
